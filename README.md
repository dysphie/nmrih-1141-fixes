Editable in `cfg/sourcemod/1141-fixes.cfg`

| Cvar                          | Values  | Description                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `hotfix_zombie_attack_bulleye` | `1`/`0` | Fixes an issue where zombies fail to attack bullseyes. This affects maps like `nmo_project_enigma` where special zombies no longer trigger explosions. |
| `hotfix_fmod_sounds`          | `1`/`0` | Fixes an issue preventing clients from hearing FMOD sounds. Affects newer maps like `nmo_cambalache_barrios` that make heavy use of them. |
| `hotfix_damage_filters`       | `1`/`0` | Fixes improper damage filter behavior, which can cause issues like special zombies not dying or dying too easily. |
